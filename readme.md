## What is Hirakata?
Hirakata is a symbol matching game with a twist. Hiragana symbols are to be matched with their corresponding katakana symbols. To play simply identify a symbol within the 4x4 grid and click it, followed by it's corresponding symbol. Should your time expire, or no more pairs can be matched, your score will be evaluated and displayed
## Where to play it?
The game should operate fine within any browser(as of 30/08/2021), simply `clone` the repo and utilise vscode's live server extension. Alternatively, (provided [repl.it](https://replit.com) doesn't cease to exist) the game may be played [here](https://Hirakata.b3stg1rlm1sh4.repl.co)
